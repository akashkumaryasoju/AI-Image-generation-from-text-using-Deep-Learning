# AI-Image-generation-from-text-using-Deep-Learning
In various field these days, AI is everywhere. It is almost as if the AI is ruling 
the whole world.AI is majorly implemented for generating images using many 
different kinds of algorithms. Our proposed system uses a powerful implementation 
of generating AI Images using Stable Diffusion Model for Text-To-Image generation. 
This proposed work provides a stylish web-based interface for real time interactions. 
The main goal of building this proposed work is to provide a seamless user experience 
where a user can give their own description (e.g., “a girl holding a puppy in 
aircraft”),and obtain a AI generated image that visually represents the given prompt. 
The core technologies used in the proposed work are, Hugging Face diffusers Library,
