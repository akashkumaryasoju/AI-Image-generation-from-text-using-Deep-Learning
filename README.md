# AI-Image-generation-from-text-using-Deep-Learning
In various field these days, AI is everywhere. It is almost as if the AI is ruling 
the whole world.AI is majorly implemented for generating images using many 
different kinds of algorithms. Our proposed system uses a powerful implementation 
of generating AI Images using Stable Diffusion Model for Text-To-Image generation. 
This proposed work provides a stylish web-based interface for real time interactions. 
The main goal of building this proposed work is to provide a seamless user experience 
where a user can give their own description (e.g., “a girl holding a puppy in 
aircraft”),and obtain a AI generated image that visually represents the given prompt. 
The core technologies used in the proposed work are, Hugging Face diffusers Library.

Motivation"

We aim to bridge the gap between language and visual imagination by enabling AI to generate realistic, semantically aligned images from text prompts. With rising demand for visual content in marketing, education, entertainment, and design, automating image creation helps users—from novices to professionals—bring ideas to life efficiently.

Objectives:

Model: Use Stable Diffusion, a state-of-the-art diffusion model, for high-quality, text-guided image synthesis.
Interface: Build an easy-to-use Gradio web app for interactive text-to-image generation, requiring no coding.
User Control: Offer adjustable settings (e.g., seed, style prompts) to guide output without overwhelming complexity.
Accessibility: Optimize performance to run on modest hardware (e.g., 4–8 GB GPUs) or lightweight cloud instances.
Creative Collaboration: Position the system as an AI partner, empowering users to visualize and iterate on ideas, not replace creativity.

Module BreakDown:

1. Gradio UI Module
Front-end built with Gradio Blocks + CSS for responsive design.
Includes a header, "Start" button, prompt textbox, “Generate” and “Try Again” buttons, and an image display area.
Validates input (non-empty, length-limited) before sending prompts to the preprocessing step.

2. Text Preprocessing Module
Uses CLIPTokenizer and CLIP Text Encoder (via Hugging Face Diffusers) to convert prompts into token embeddings.
Outputs dense semantic vectors for prompting Stable Diffusion.

3. Stable Diffusion Pipeline Module
Core generation pipeline with VAE, U-Net (50–100 denoising steps, cross-attention), and CLIP conditioning.
Loads CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4 model, runs on GPU with PyTorch fp16.
Processes text embeddings into latent image representations.

4. Image Processing Module
Preprocesses latent output (normalize to 512×512 RGB, range [-1,1]).
Converts VAE-decoded output to a clean PIL image for display via Gradio.

5. Hugging Face API Integration Module
Handles authentication via notebook_login() and securely loads pre-trained model/checkpoints.
Manages API usage, reducing developer setup complexity.

6. GPU Execution Module
Enables fast, efficient inference using CUDA and mixed-precision fp16 on consumer GPUs.
Ensures near real-time image generation (~seconds per image).

Output Stimulation Example:

It generates the output from the input text we give.For example for the input
"A ballerina dancing"., 
“A dog playing with ball.” ,
“A castle that floats upside 
down above a mirror lake, it 
reflecting the real world. ” -it provides the desired output in the form of an image as the file attached in repository.
